\subsubsection{Gathering a Packet trace}

After running \texttt{ipconfig} with both the \texttt{/release} and
\texttt{/renew} options, we were able to see the following packets:

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/6/dhcp_packets.png}
    \caption{\texttt{DHCP packets}}\label{fig:dhcp_packets}
\end{figure}

We then selected the first packet, which represents the DHCP Discover message.
We can see that it uses the UDP protocol, its source address is
\texttt{0.0.0.0}, and the destination address is \texttt{255.255.255.255}.

The \texttt{0.0.0.0} address is used as the requesting machine has no assigned
IPv4 address in the local network, and thus uses the \texttt{255.255.255.255}
address (broadcast) to \textbf{discover} DHCP servers.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/6/discover_header.png}
    \caption{\texttt{DHCP Discover header}}\label{fig:discover_header}
\end{figure}

We can also see that the transaction ID is \texttt{0x2668b858}.

After examining the \textbf{options} field, we can see 5 different pieces of
information that are requested.

\begin{itemize}
    \item DHCP message type (Discover)
    \item Parameter Request List
    \item Maximum DHCP message size
    \item Client identifier
    \item IP Address Lease Time
\end{itemize}

Now, let's take a look at the DHCP offer message. Its data is shown below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/6/offer_header.png}
    \caption{\texttt{DHCP Offer header}}\label{fig:offer_header}
\end{figure}

We know that the offer message is a response to the previous discover message
because they use the same transaction ID. Furthermore the source IP address is
\texttt{10.100.224.1}, which is the default gateway (router address). The
destination address is the IPv4 address that would be leased to our machine.

The DHCP server also sends some information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item DHCP message type (Offer)
    \item Subnet Mask
    \item Renewal Time Value
    \item Rebinding Time Value
    \item DHCP Server identifier
\end{itemize}

After examining the offer message, it's now the turn of the request message.
Below is a screenshot of its information:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/6/request_header.png}
    \caption{\texttt{DHCP Request header}}\label{fig:request_header}
\end{figure}

The UDP source port number is 68, and the destination is 67. The source and
destination IP addresses are \texttt{0.0.0.0} and \texttt{255.255.255.255}
respectively. Also, the transaction ID matches the two previous packets, which
makes sense. The parameter request list is exactly the same.

Finally, we will take a look at the ACK message.
