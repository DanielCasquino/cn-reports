\section*{Conclusions and Recommendations}

The experiments in this lab consolidated the intuition gained during the
previous reports.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{traceroute} gave us a good understanding of TTL depletion and
          the mechanics of IPv4 fragmentation, and highlighted the differences between ICMP
          and UDP probes.
    \item The IPv6 AAAA capture proved that the stack is already dual-stack on campus,
          and showed DNS resolution for IPv6 hosts in action.
    \item The NAT traces showed that only the addresses and checksums change as traffic
          crosses a boundary
    \item ICMP error captures explained why type/code pairs carry so much diagnostic
          value, and how different errors are generated in response to different
          situations.
    \item The PMTUD sweeps clarified how routers signal ``fragmentation needed''
    \item Finally, the DHCP handshake showed us that leases, options, and transaction IDs
          need to be set up before a host joins the network.

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
