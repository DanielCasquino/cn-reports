\section*{Conclusions and Recommendations}

Building the patch cable underscored how much link quality depends on details:
maintaining pair order (T568A), preserving twists up to the plug, and driving
the crimp so each blade fully seats. A simple continuity test immediately
validated that all eight conductors were correctly terminated and no pairs were
crossed.

For future labs we recommend always keeping the jacket inside the plug for
strain relief, trimming wires to equal length before insertion, and running the
tester twice (one quick pass and one slow) to catch intermittent contacts.
Labeling the cable with the scheme used (A) also helps avoid mistakes when
making crossover cables later on.
