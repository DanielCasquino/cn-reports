\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}

In this lab experience, we learned how \texttt{ping} and \texttt{traceroute}
work at a high level by working with Python. We were already familiar with the
ICMP datagram structure thanks to the previous lab report, so implementing the
missing parts of the scripts was not a difficult task.

We also tested both implementations with three different hostnames, showing the
varying RTT and responses for each one. We saw some differences in the
\texttt{traceroute} output, specially when pinging \texttt{google.com}. There
were several timeouts, which could be due to packet loss (unlikely),
intermediate router configuration (more likely), or ICMP rate limiting as a
security measure on Google's side (most likely).
