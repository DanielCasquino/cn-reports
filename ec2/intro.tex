\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is commonly used for diagnostic
and error reporting, and operates at the network layer. Some well-known
commands that utilize this protocol include \texttt{ping} and
\texttt{traceroute}.

In this short lab report, we will describe the process of implementing both
commands in Python, using the \texttt{socket} library to send and receive ICMP
packets while communicating with hosts at different locations.
