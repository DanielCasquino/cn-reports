\section*{Conclusion}

In this report, we utilized Wireshark to analyze the content and behaviour of
HTTP packets in a series of small experiments. By observing the HTTP GET
requests and responses, we understood how communication between hosts and
servers happens, as well as the different HTTP versions, status codes, and
headers.

The lab experience with long documents and embedded objects showed how data
transmitted via TCP is segmented into packets and how browsers handle multiple
resource requests.

On the other hand, the authentication section helped us see how credentials are
transmitted in a slightly ``secure'' way by using base64 encoding.

To summarize, these experiences reinforced newly learned computer networks
concepts, and also highlighted the importance Wireshark as a packet analysis
tool.

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
