\subsubsection{OSI Model}
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, developed by the ISO
(International Standards Organization), is a model that establishes standards
for network communication between systems. It consists of 7 layers:
Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and
Physical~\cite{tanenbaum:networks}.

\subsubsection{IP Address}
An IP address is a unique identifier that represents a device on a network. An
IPv4 address is 32 bits long, and is written in dotted decimal notation; that
is, the address is divided into groups of 4 bytes, each one written in decimal
and divided by dots~\cite{tanenbaum:networks}.

\subsubsection{TCP}
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol designed for
reliable process-to-process communication in a
network~\cite{tanenbaum:networks}. It enables byte transfer by packing them
into segments, and ensures that all data is received by assigning an
indentifier to each segment, thus allowing the sender to retransmit lost
segments and the receiver to reorder them or request their
retransmission.~\cite{rfc793}.

\subsubsection{User Datagram Protocol (UDP)}
UDP is a minimalist transport: connectionless datagrams, port demultiplexing
and a checksum; no built-in reliability, ordering, congestion or flow control.
That keeps latency and header overhead low, while pushing reliability/rate
control to the application or a higher layer~\cite{rfc768,rfc8085,kurose:2021}.

\subsubsection{HTTP}
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application level protocol that
operates over TCP and defines the format of requests and responses for messages
between servers and clients. It uses headers and methods (GET, POST, DELETE,
etc) to carry extra data for specific needs.~\cite{rfc9110}.

\subsubsection{Network Packet}
A packet is the atomic unit on packet-switched networks: a payload preceded by
a header carrying control metadata (addresses, length, integrity,
fragmentation/ordering). Large messages are segmented into packets that may
take different routes and are reassembled at the
destination~\cite{tanenbaum:networks,rfc791,kurose:2021}.

\subsubsection{Wireshark}
Wireshark is a FOSS for network packet analysis. Available in Linux, Windows,
and macOS, it allows users to capture and display live packets being sent and
received by any network device in their computers~\cite{wireshark:guide}.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\subsection{State of the Art}
HTTP/1.1 defined the core, stateless request-response semantics we still use
(methods, status codes, headers) and introduced persistent connections and
chunked transfer. But it processes one response per TCP connection at a time,
so a slow object can stall the rest; verbose, uncompressed headers add
overhead~\cite{rfc9110}.

HTTP/2 rethinks framing while preserving semantics. Messages are split into
binary frames and multiplexed as independent streams on a single TCP
connection, with HPACK header compression and stream prioritization. This
dramatically reduces head-of-line blocking at the \emph{application} layer, but
TCP's in-order delivery still imposes transport HOL if a packet is lost
~\cite{rfc9113}.

HTTP Secure. HTTPS is HTTP carried over TLS.\@ The \texttt{https} scheme
mandates authenticated encryption (server certificates) and integrity
protection; with TLS~1.3 handshakes (and resumption), setup is typically
1-RTT/0-RTT.\@ In practice, browsers/CDNs default to HTTPS, and many platform
features require it; ALPN steers negotiation of H2/H3 over the same secure
channel~\cite{rfc8446,rfc9110}.

TLS1.3 modernized security: forward-secure key exchange only, simpler ciphers,
and a 1-RTT handshake. That trims time-to-first-byte for secure HTTP and
removed legacy downgrade vectors present in older versions~\cite{rfc8446}.

QUIC moves innovation into the transport. Built on UDP, it offers reliable
delivery with \emph{multiple} independently flow-controlled streams, so a loss
only stalls its streamâ€”not the whole connection. QUIC also folds TLS1.3 into
the handshake and supports connection migration via stable Connection IDs,
letting sessions survive IP changes~\cite{rfc9000}.

HTTP/3 maps HTTP onto QUIC.\@ It keeps HTTP/2's binary framing and multiplexing
semantics but delegates flow control, loss recovery and stream lifetime to
QUIC, eliminating TCP-level HOL and reducing handshake latency thanks to
integrated TLS.\@ In practice, H3 tends to shine on high-latency, lossy, and
mobile paths; on clean low-latency links, the gap vs. H2 narrows
~\cite{rfc9114,perna2022,trevisan2021}.

Recent measurements refine the picture. Large-scale studies report that H3
adoption is growing (CDNs and major origins) and that benefits are clearest
when most page dependencies are also served over H3; otherwise, mixed H2/H3
pages dilute gains~\cite{perna2022,trevisan2021}. New work explores proxies and
prioritization: under severe loss/latency, H3 can outperform H2 substantially,
while advanced prioritization schemes further improve H3 page metrics
~\cite{liu2024,gupta2024}.

In short, the stack is converging on: HTTP semantics to HTTP/3 over QUIC to
TLS1.3 by default. The payoff lower latency under real-world network variance,
robust mobility, and stronger security depends on deployment breadth and
maturity of implementations~\cite{rfc9114,rfc9000,rfc8446}.
