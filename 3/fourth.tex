\subsection{Fourth Experience}

\subsubsection{TCP Basics}

The sequence number used to initiate the connection in the SYN segment is 0.

I have to clue where the SYN segment is.

The SYN ACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu has a sequence number of 0 as
well.

The TCP segment corresponding to the POST command has two kinds of sequence
number:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Relative Seq Num: 1
	\item Raw Seq Num: 281584053
\end{itemize}

(here we say what each one means)

If we consider the POST segment to be the first one if the TCP connection, the
first six segments's data would be:

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Segment & Sent            & ACK             & RTT        & Est. RTT     \\
		\hline
		1       & 20:34:29.490478 & 20:34:29.641190 & 0:0:150712 & 0:0:150712   \\
		2       & 20:32:29.490574 & 20:34:29.641190 & 0:0:150616 & 0:0:1507005  \\
		3       & 20:34:29.641199 & 20:34:29.688695 & 0:0:47496  & 0:0:13779994 \\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{TCP Congestion Control}

The sequence number used to initiate the connection in the SYN segment is 0.

I have to clue where the SYN segment is.

The SYN ACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu has a sequence number of 0 as
well.
