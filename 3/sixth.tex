\subsection{Sixth Experience}

\subsubsection{Python TCP Server-Client Implementation}
For this experience we needed to capture on the loopback (lo) interface of wireshark, because we are going to send a file to our own machine.

For this purpose we set the port and host with the bind function of the library socket of Python. To ensure the three-way handshake we used the connect function on the client, and the listen and accept functions on the server, all functions of the same library.

Finally, we open two terminals on the same computer and in one we runned the tcp\_server.py file and in the other one the tcp\_client.py file with the corresponding host, port and a file to test the connection and, as we can see in the figure above, it connected with no problem.
